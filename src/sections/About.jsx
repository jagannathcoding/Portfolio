          Iâ€™m a passionate developer with a focus on creating beautiful, functional web applications. I am constantly evolving as a front-end engineer and designer, driven by my desire to build elegant and user-friendly interfaces. 
          <br /><br />
          I specialize in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js</strong>, with a growing interest in <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>UX/UI design principles</strong>. I graduated in 2023 with a degree in Computer Science Engineering from Future Institute of Technology, West Bengal. 
          <br /><br />
          I am always eager to collaborate on exciting new projects and ready to dive into new challenges. Open to opportunities worldwide!
